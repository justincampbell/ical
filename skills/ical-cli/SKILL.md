# ical — macOS Calendar CLI

## Current date context

Resolved fresh every time the skill loads. Prefer these over guessing from context.

- Today: !`date +"%A, %B %-d, %Y"`
- Today (ISO): !`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- Local time: !`date +"%H:%M %Z"`
- Tomorrow (ISO): !`date -v+1d +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- Next Monday (ISO, always forward): !`date -v+1d -v+mon +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- Next Friday (ISO, always forward): !`date -v+1d -v+fri +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- End of week (Sunday, ISO): !`date -v+1d -v+sun +"%Y-%m-%d"`

ical also accepts natural-language strings directly (`today`, `tomorrow`, `next friday`, `in 3 hours`, `eow`, `mar 15`). When in doubt, pass the user's own phrasing through — the parser handles it.

## When to use this skill

| User intent | Command |
| --- | --- |
| "What's on my calendar today" | `ical today` |
| "What's coming up this week" | `ical upcoming --days 7` |
| "List events between X and Y" | `ical list --from X --to Y` |
| "Show me event N" | `ical show <row-number>` |
| "Add / schedule / book a meeting" | `ical add "title" --start X --end Y --calendar C` |
| "Move / reschedule an event" | `ical update <row-number> --start X --end Y` |
| "Rename / retitle an event" | `ical update <row-number> --title "new"` |
| "Change an event's notes / location" | `ical update <row-number> --notes "..." --location "..."` |
| "Cancel / delete an event" | `ical delete <row-number> --force` |
| "Delete these events" | `ical delete <n1> <n2> <n3> --force` (batch, one invocation) |
| "Find events about X" | `ical search "X" --from today --to "in 30 days"` |
| "Events involving <person>" | `ical list --from today --to "in 14 days" --attendee <name>` |
| "Show only one-off events" | `ical upcoming --days 7 --no-recurring` |
| "Invite people to a meeting" | `ical add "title" --start X --calendar C --invite a@x.com --invite "Bob <b@y.com>"` |
| "Join my next meeting / get the call link" | `ical join` (opens it) or `ical join --print` (just the URL) |
| "Accept / decline / tentatively accept an invite" | `ical rsvp accepted\|declined\|tentative <row-number>` |
| "When is <person> free / busy" | `ical free a@x.com --from X --to Y` (needs Exchange/Workspace, NOT iCloud) |
| "What invitations am I waiting on" | `ical inbox` |
| "Add travel time before an event" | `ical add "title" --start X --travel 30m` |
| "List / create / rename / delete calendars" | `ical calendars [create\|update\|delete]` |
| "Export / back up events" | `ical export --format json --output-file backup.json` |

This table covers the common intents. If you need a flag that isn't shown above, **don't guess** — either run `ical <command> --help` (or `-h`) to get the authoritative flag list with defaults, or load [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for the full reference. `--help` is fast, accurate, and safe to run repeatedly; prefer it over guessing a flag name from convention.

Load [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) when you need every column of a flag (short form, default, type), or when `--help` alone isn't enough context.

Load [references/dates.md](references/dates.md) when a date string fails to parse, or when the user asks what date formats are supported.

## Batch everything into one tool call

Every `ical` invocation is fast (<200ms), so the expensive part is YOUR round trip, not the command. Two rules:

1. **Multiple events, one command.** `ical delete` accepts multiple row numbers or IDs and batch-deletes them in one EventKit session: `ical delete 1 3 5 --force`. Never loop one event per call.
2. **Multiple commands, one Bash call.** When answering one question needs several ical reads, chain them with plain `;` and `echo` header markers in a single Bash invocation — never run them as separate tool calls. Avoid `{ }` grouping and `$(...)` substitution: permission allowlists match per `;`-separated segment, and `ical`/`echo`/`jq`/`xargs ical` are pre-approved by this skill.

```bash
# Daily briefing — one tool call, not two
echo "== TODAY =="; ical today -o plain; echo "== NEXT 7 DAYS =="; ical upcoming --days 7 -o plain
```

## Workflow: identify an event before acting on it

Agents usually can't assume they know the right event ID. The robust pattern:

1. Run a listing (`ical list`, `ical today`, `ical upcoming`) to find the event.
2. Note the row number (`#1`, `#2`...) shown in the output.
3. Act on it by row number: `ical show 2`, `ical update 3 --title "..."`, `ical delete 1 --force`.

Row numbers are cached per session and stay valid until the next listing command in the same session runs. The session is the first of `ICAL_SESSION`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `TMUX_PANE`, `WEZTERM_PANE`, `KITTY_WINDOW_ID`, `ITERM_SESSION_ID` or `TERM_SESSION_ID` that is set; with none set, every process shares `~/.ical-last-list`. If you need a stable reference across sessions, capture the full event ID with `-o json | jq -r '.[0].id'` and use `--id "<id>"` for exact lookup.

## Gotchas (read before running)

- **`ical delete` prompts for interactive confirmation.** In any non-interactive context, pass `--force`. There is no `--confirm` flag.
- **`ical update` has no `--force` and never confirms.** Run it directly with the flags you want changed.
- **Row numbers reset on every listing.** Running `ical today` invalidates the row numbers from a previous `ical list`.
- **`--id` is exact match only.** No prefix search, no partial match. Pass a full event ID from JSON output.
- **`--id` and positional event args are mutually exclusive.** Pass one or the other.
- **Every occurrence of a recurring series shares one ID** (detached ones add `/RID=…`). A row number targets the occurrence that row showed. With `--id`, add `--occurrence <date>` (or `"<date> <time>"` when a day has several) to `show`/`update`/`delete`; without it, the series' first occurrence is used. `--span this|future|all` sets the scope from there.
- **`--repeat-days` only applies to `--repeat weekly`.** With any other frequency the CLI errors out. The recurrence engine silently discards the days otherwise.
- **Timezone abbreviations (EST, CDT, BST, IST...) are rejected** inside date strings. Use `--timezone America/New_York` instead, with IANA names.
- **Event IDs are calendar-scoped.** The UUID before `:` is the calendar ID shared by every event in that calendar. Short prefixes cannot disambiguate events within one calendar — prefer row numbers or `--id "<full>"`. `ical add` and `ical update` print the full ID (and the full event with `-o json`), so capture it from there.
- **Inviting attendees sends real email.** `ical add --invite a@x.com` adds the person and the calendar account dispatches an invitation on save — there is no dry-run. Only invite addresses the user actually intends to notify. The organizer (the user) is added automatically, so a 1-invitee event shows 2 attendees.
- **`--invite` is repeatable; one address per flag.** `--invite a@x.com --invite "Bob <b@y.com>"`. Do NOT pack multiple addresses into one value (`--invite "a@x.com,b@y.com"`) — that's rejected. Accepts a bare email or `Name <email>`.
- **The `--attendee` flag on list/search is a read-only filter, not an invite.** Use `--invite` on `add` to invite.
- **Free/busy (`ical free`) needs an Exchange or Google Workspace account.** iCloud does not support availability lookups, so `ical free` against an iCloud-only setup reports no supporting account. Querying an iCloud address returns "free for the whole window" (no data), not an error.
- **`ical rsvp` only works on events that are invitations to you.** RSVPing your own event is a harmless no-op. Status words: `accepted`/`declined`/`tentative` (aliases `yes`/`no`/`maybe`).
- **`ical inbox` invitations carry no stable ID** — you can't pass them to `rsvp` by reference. Respond via `ical rsvp <status>` (interactive picker) or find the event with `ical list` first and use its row number.
- **Subscribed calendars and the Birthdays calendar are read-only.** Event creation against them fails.
- **`--calendar` / `-c` is repeatable.** Pass multiple times to filter by several calendars: `ical list -c Work -c Personal`. Single `-c` is optimized server-side; multiple values filter client-side.
- **Calendar-name matching on `--calendar` and `--exclude-calendar` is case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed**, so `"  Work "` and `work` both match a calendar named `Work`.
- **EventKit adjusts some hex colors** during save (e.g. `#FF6961` → `#FF8073`). This is CGColor conversion, not a bug.
- **`ical` is macOS-only.** No fallback on Linux or Windows.

## Output formats

All read commands accept `-o`:

- `table` (default) — bordered, colored, human-oriented, with a `Date` column that prints only on day transitions. When events span multiple years, the year is included in the date column
- `json` — ISO 8601 timestamps, full fields, safe for scripts and agents
- `plain` — one event per line, grep-friendly

**Event JSON fields**: `id`, `title`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `all_day`, `calendar`, `calendar_id`, `location`, `notes`, `url`, `conference_url`, `travel_time`, `self_status`, `status`, `availability`, `organizer`, `attendees`, `recurring`, `recurrence_rules`, `is_detached`, `occurrence_date`, `alerts`, `timezone`, `created_at`, `modified_at`. `conference_url` is the detected meeting link; `travel_time` is a compact string (`"30m"`); `self_status` is your RSVP (`accepted`/`declined`/`tentative`) on invitations. `show -o json` and `list -o json` use the same field names.

**Calendar JSON fields**: `id`, `title`, `type`, `color`, `source`, `readOnly`. Note the list key is `title`, not `name`.

### JSON output gotchas

- Dates are **ISO 8601 UTC** (`2026-04-18T15:00:00Z`), not local time. Convert in jq with `fromdate | strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")` if you need local wall-clock.
- Optional fields (`location`, `url`, `notes`, `organizer`, `attendees`, `recurrence_rules`, `timezone`) are **omitted when empty** — use `.location // ""` in jq rather than assuming the key exists.
- `recurrence_rules` is an **array**. An event with one rule still comes back as `[rule]`. The cheap "is this event repeating" check is the top-level `recurring: true` boolean.
- Inside a recurrence rule, `frequency` is an **integer enum** (`0=daily`, `1=weekly`, `2=monthly`, `3=yearly`), not a string. Compare against the int.
- `alerts[].relativeOffset` is a **negative nanosecond duration** for before-event alerts. 15 minutes before = `-900000000000`. Divide by `-1e9` for seconds, or use `((. / -1000000000) / 60)` in jq for minutes.
- `attendees[].status` is an **integer**, not a string — unlike event-level `status` and `availability` which serialize as strings. Map the int yourself if you need a label.
- `attendees` is populated by `--invite` on `ical add` (not `update`); you cannot *remove* an attendee through the CLI. `self_status` reflects your own RSVP and updates after `ical rsvp`.

## Interactive mode

- `ical add -i` — guided form for title, calendar, dates, location, recurrence, alerts.
- `ical update <n> -i` — pre-filled form with current values.
- `ical show` / `ical update` / `ical delete` with zero args — launches a searchable event picker.

Skip `-i` and zero-arg invocations when running non-interactively — they block on stdin. Agents should always pass explicit flags or a row number.

## Recurrence

```bash
# Daily
ical add "Standup" --start "tomorrow at 9am" --repeat daily

# Every 2 weeks on Mon and Wed (only weekly accepts --repeat-days)
ical add "Team sync" --start "next monday at 10am" \
  --repeat weekly --repeat-interval 2 --repeat-days mon,wed

# Monthly for 6 occurrences
ical add "Review" --start "mar 1 at 2pm" --repeat monthly --repeat-count 6

# Yearly until a date
ical add "Anniversary" --start "jun 15" --repeat yearly --repeat-until "2030-06-15"
```

`ical update <n> --repeat none` removes recurrence. `ical update <n> --span future` changes this and all future occurrences; without it only the single instance is modified.

To delete a whole recurring series use `ical delete <n> --span all`. The default `--span this` removes only one occurrence — the rest of the series stays.

## Alerts

Repeatable `--alert` flag on `ical add` and `ical update`. Units: `m`, `h`, `d`.

```bash
ical add "Flight" --start "mar 15 at 8am" --alert 1h --alert 1d
```

Calendars contribute their own default alerts to every new event. Two ways to opt out:

```bash
# Explicit --alert already overrides the calendar default — you get
# exactly the alerts you list, no calendar defaults mixed in
ical add "Focus time" --start "tomorrow 2pm" --end "tomorrow 4pm" --alert 15m

# No alerts at all (useful for mirrored busy blocks)
ical add "Busy block" --start "tomorrow 9am" --end "tomorrow 10am" --no-alert
```

Rule of thumb: passing **any** `--alert` gives you exactly those alerts. Passing **no** `--alert` and no `--no-alert` inherits the calendar's default alerts. Passing `--no-alert` gives you zero alerts regardless of the calendar.

## Calendar management

```bash
ical calendars                                              # list (alias: cals)
ical calendars create "Projects" --source iCloud --color "#FF6961"
ical calendars update "Projects" --name "Side projects"
ical calendars delete "Projects" --force
```

`create` requires `--source`. Valid sources come from existing calendars — inspect `ical calendars -o json | jq -r '.[].source' | sort -u` to discover them on the user's machine.

## Common recipes

```bash
# Count today's events
ical today -o json | jq 'length'

# First event of the day
ical today -o json | jq -r '.[0] | "\(.title) at \(.start_date)"'

# Next event involving a teammate
ical list --from today --to "in 14 days" --attendee claire -o json | jq '.[0]'

# Rest of the week, skipping recurring noise
ical list --from today --to "end of week" --no-recurring

# Bulk delete everything matching a search (careful) — xargs passes ALL
# ids to a single batch `ical delete`, not one process per event
ical search "temp" --from today --to "in 7 days" -o json \
  | jq -r '.[].id' \
  | xargs ical delete --force

# Weekly agenda export
ical export --from today --to "in 7 days" --format ics --output-file week.ics
```

## Scheduling: invites, RSVP, availability, conference links

```bash
# Invite people to a new meeting (sends invitations on save)
ical add "Design review" --start "tomorrow 3pm" --calendar Work \
  --invite alice@example.com --invite "Bob <bob@example.com>" --travel 30m

# Respond to an invitation by row number (from a prior listing)
ical rsvp accepted 3
ical rsvp tentative            # no row number → interactive picker

# Free/busy across people (Exchange/Google Workspace only — not iCloud)
ical free alice@example.com bob@example.com --from "monday 9am" --to "monday 6pm"

# Open the conference link of the current or next meeting
ical join                      # opens it in the browser
ical join --print              # prints just the URL (pipe-friendly)

# See invitations awaiting a response
ical inbox
ical inbox -o json
```

`ical free` prints each person's busy blocks; an address with no busy periods shows "free for the whole window". `--invite` and `--travel` are NOT available in interactive (`-i`) mode — pass them on the command line.

## Limits

- Attendee invites send real email; there is no dry-run. You can add attendees but not remove them via the CLI.
- Free/busy requires an Exchange or Google Workspace account; iCloud does not support it.
- Subscribed and Birthdays calendars are read-only.
- macOS only.
