3. **String** — full or partial event ID (positional arg)
4. **`--id`** — full event ID, exact match only (preferred for scripts/agents)

With an argument, resolves a row number or event ID like `show`.

```bash
ical join                 # open the current/next meeting link in the browser
ical join --print         # print just the URL (pipe-friendly, opens nothing)
ical join 3               # join the event at row 3 of the last listing
ical join -d 1            # only look 1 day ahead
ical join -o json         # full event JSON instead of opening
```

## ical rsvp

Respond to an event invitation. The first argument is the response; the second optionally selects the event (row number or ID). With no event argument, an interactive picker over the next 90 days is shown. On a server-backed calendar this sends the reply to the organizer.

```bash
ical rsvp accepted 3       # accept the event at row 3
ical rsvp declined <id>    # decline by event ID
ical rsvp tentative        # pick interactively
```

Response words: `accepted`, `declined`, `tentative` (aliases `yes`/`no`/`maybe`). RSVPing your own (non-invitation) event is a harmless no-op.

## ical free

Look up free/busy availability for one or more people over a window. **Requires an Exchange or Google Workspace account** — iCloud does not support availability lookups.

```bash
ical free alice@example.com
ical free alice@example.com bob@example.com --from "monday 9am" --to "monday 6pm"
```

| Flag     | Short | Description                  | Default |
| -------- | ----- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `--from` | `-f`  | Start of the window          | now     |
| `--to`   | `-t`  | End of the window            | +24h    |

Prints each person's busy blocks; an address with no busy periods (or one whose server returns nothing, e.g. an iCloud address) shows "free for the whole window".

---

## ical inbox

List event invitations awaiting your response (the Calendar.app notification inbox).

```bash
ical inbox
ical inbox -o json
```

No flags beyond the global `--output`. Invitations carry no stable ID, so respond via `ical rsvp <status>` (interactive picker), or find the event with `ical list` and use its row number.

---

## ical export

Export events to JSON, CSV, or ICS format.

```bash
ical export > events.json
ical export --format ics --output-file events.ics
ical export --calendar Work --from today --to "in 6 months" --format csv
```

| Flag            | Short | Description                     | Default       |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--from`        | `-f`  | Start date                      | 30 days ago   |
| `--to`          | `-t`  | End date                        | 30 days ahead |
| `--calendar`    | `-c`  | Filter by calendar (repeatable) | All calendars |
| `--format`      | —     | Format: json, csv, ics          | json          |
| `--output-file` | —     | Write to file instead of stdout | stdout        |

---

## ical import

Import events from a JSON or CSV file. Format is auto-detected from file extension.

```bash
ical import events.json
ical import events.csv --calendar "Imported"
ical import backup.json --dry-run
ical import data.json --force
```

| Flag         | Short | Description                             | Default           |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `--calendar` | `-c`  | Override target calendar for all events | Original calendar |
| `--dry-run`  | —     | Preview without creating events         | false             |
| `--force`    | `-f`  | Skip confirmation prompt                | false             |

## ical skills

Manage AI agent skills. The ical binary embeds its own agent skill files and can install them directly into the skills directory of supported AI coding agents.

### ical skills install

Install the ical agent skill for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Augment). Without `--agent`, shows an interactive multi-select picker followed by a confirmation prompt. The skill files are the same documentation published at https://ical.sidv.dev/docs.

```bash
ical skills install --dry-run         # Preview files without writing
ical skills install                   # Interactive — pick agents + confirm
ical skills install --agent claude    # Direct — Claude Code only
ical skills install --agent codex     # Direct — Codex CLI only
ical skills install --agent openclaw  # Direct — OpenClaw only
ical skills install --agent all       # All agents
```

| Flag        | Short | Description                                         | Default     |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `--agent`   | —     | Target agent: claude, codex, openclaw, others, or all | Interactive |
| `--dry-run` | —     | Preview what would be installed without writing        | false       |

Supported targets:
- `claude` → `~/.claude/skills/ical-cli/` (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Augment)
- `codex` → `~/.codex/skills/ical-cli/` (Codex CLI)
- `openclaw` → `~/.openclaw/skills/ical-cli/` (OpenClaw)
- `others` → `~/.agents/skills/ical-cli/` (Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, Augment)

### ical skills uninstall

Remove the ical agent skill. Same `--agent` flag and interactive picker as install.

```bash
ical skills uninstall
ical skills uninstall --agent claude
```

| Flag      | Short | Description                          | Default     |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `--agent` | —     | Target agent: claude, codex, or all  | Interactive |

### ical skills status

Show where skills are installed and whether they match the current binary version.

```bash
ical skills status
```

---

## ical version

Print version and build information. This command never prints an update or skills-staleness notice — its output is exactly one line, safe to parse.

```bash
ical version
```

Output format: `ical <version> (commit <hash>, built <date>)`

---

## ical completion

Generate shell completion scripts.

```bash
ical completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ical
ical completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ical"
ical completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ical.fish
```

---

## Global Flags

These flags are available on all commands:

| Flag         | Short | Description                       | Default |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--output`   | `-o`  | Output format: table, json, plain | table   |
| `--no-color` | —     | Disable color output              | false   |

The `NO_COLOR` environment variable is also respected.

### Post-run notices

Two notices can follow a command: a new release is available, or installed skills are older than the binary. Both go to **stderr**, never stdout.

**Do not set `ICAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` to keep stdout parseable.** `ical <command> -o json` always emits valid JSON on stdout. Parse stdout directly.

No notice prints when any of these holds:

- `-o json` is used
- stderr is not a terminal — any pipe or redirect, including `2>&1 | jq`
- the command is `version`, `completion`, or a `skills` subcommand
- the binary is a dev build

Set `ICAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` only if your harness gives ical a pseudo-terminal on stderr and captures it. Otherwise use `2>/dev/null`.
